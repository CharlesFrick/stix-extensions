# Open Cybersecurity Alliance Playbooks

## Overview

To defend against threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures organizations need to detect, investigate, prevent, mitigate, and remediate threats in cyber relevant time. To do this, organizations need to identify, create, document, and test the orchestration steps needed to achieve these outcomes. These steps, when grouped together, form a cyber security playbook that can be used to protect organizational systems, networks, data, and users [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0].

The STIX x-oca-playbook SDO allows the inclusion of playbooks in STIX CTI. The playbooks may be represented using existing specifications such as Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). x-oca-playbook SDOs may then be referenced in the extended STIX Course of Action SDO that allows for the sharing automated courses of action (i.e., orchestration workflows or playbooks).
