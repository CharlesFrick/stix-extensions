# Open Cybersecurity Alliance Indicators of Behavior (IOB)

The following overview is derived from the IOB WG charter.

The IOB WG charter is available [here](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/oca-iob/blob/main/charter.md).

## Overview

IOBs are patterns of behavior associated with malicious cyber activity. By understanding “normal” and possibly malicious behaviors or patterns of activity in our networks we can develop innovative solutions that enable us to share behavior sets (aka sets of adversarial behaviors) amongst the CTI community. These behavior sets and associated detection strategies will lead to more proactive detection, more effective mitigations and, through timely and actionable sharing, more prevention than what is currently possible with Indicators of Compromise.
